## 02. Build From Source

- Clone the git repo: `git clone https://github.com/nirgeier/AnsibleLabs.git`
- Navigate to the Labs directory: `cd AnsibleLabs/Labs/000-setup`
- The lab contains the `docker-compose` file along with the Dockerfile(s)
  The containers are based upon ubuntu and are published to DockerHub as well.
- Build the demo containers
- The docker-compose will create `ansible-controller` which will server as our controller to execute ansible playbooks on our demo servers defined by the names `linux-server-X`

!!! warning "Labs containers"
      
      | Container                | Content                                              |
      |--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
      | üê≥  `ansible-controller` | Linux container with ansible installed               |
      | üê≥  `linux-server-1`     | Linux container with ssh only (no ansible installed) |
      | üê≥  `linux-server-2`     | Linux container with ssh only (no ansible installed) |
      | üê≥   `linux-server-3`    | Linux container with ssh only (no ansible installed) |

* For the demo we will also need a shared folder(s) where the certificates and the configuration will be stored
* The shared folder(s) will be mounted into the containers
* The containers will have access to the shared folder(s) for reading and writing files
* The shared folder(s) will be used to store the Ansible playbooks and inventory files
* The shared folder(s) will be mounted at `/labs-scripts` in the containers
